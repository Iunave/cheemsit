# cheemsit
cheemsify your image files!

cheemsit will scan your file directory and test for image files (png and jpeg only) and attempt to replace them

code that actually replaces the images has been removed due to safety reasons, so this program SHOULD be completely harmless to run

if you want the "fun" version, just message me!
