# cheemsit
cheemsify your image files!

cheemsit will scan your file directory and test for image files (png and jpeg only) and attempt to replace them

code that actually replaces the images has been removed due to safety reasons, so this program SHOULD be completely harmless to run

![Alt text](cheemsit/content/cheems.png/?raw=true "cheems")

cheemsit is written in x86_64 intel assembly and a bash script to build it

not sure why github identifies this as 50% c++
